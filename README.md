# Image Compression using KMeans Clustering

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements image compression using the KMeans clustering algorithm to reduce the color palette of images. Users can upload an image, specify the desired number of colors, and view a side-by-side comparison of the original and compressed versions. The application showcases how unsupervised machine learning can be applied to practical image processing tasks.
